    Indigenous people of Canada suffer from mental health issues more than their non-Indigenous counterparts. Among Indigenous people who did experience a mental health problem were much more likely than the rest of Canadians to seek professional help. In some groups, the number of Indigenous people seeking help was as high as 17%â€”compared to the Canadian average of 8%.These numbers would probably have been even higher if more mental health professionals were available in isolated areas. This website is dedicated to mental health issues in Indigenous people. We're here to help you find quality information, provide you with the cultural ceremonies taking place near you and explore strategies to help you take care of your mental health. We have a group of dedicated people trained on mental health issues who can listen to your problems and provide some feedback. This website is for Indigenous people. Our goal is to assist them, not to enforce anything on them.</p>
